            <h3 class="small-text">My family is the most importnat part of my life. This site is dedicated to introducing my family and sharing a little bit about what makes them special.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text"> My name is Deron, and im 16 yearsold. I'm currently a student studying programming at RHS. I play rhythm games and I also play a little bit of guitar.
 One of my biggest dreams is to finish college and help my family from financial problems. From my family, I've learned the importance of perseverance and kindness.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text">My Father is the pillar of my Family. He is currently (age), and He's an freelancer. He's kind of a workaholic, and our home is always filled with the aroma of food. My parents have always emphasized the importance of education and hardwork, and His dream is to see his children to succeed in whatever path we chose. Iv'e learned from them the value of dedication and the power of love in keeping a family together.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text">Unfortunately my grandparents have passed away, but they were fun to be with and had teached me how to be me I always hang around with them although, sometimes I still get scolded for being too playful. Sometimes we just can't enjoy our childhood, but childhood without grandparents is worse so make sure to spend some spare time with them as soon as its possible.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text">I have 2 siblings: Derick and Danisa. My ate is 21 years old and is currently doing nothing but help with chores sometimes. brother is 24 years old and loves playing video games. Both of them have big dreamsâ€” my ate wants to become a flight attendant, and my brother dreams of becoming a Entrepreneur. from my siblings, I've learned the value of teamwork and how important it is to have someone to share life's experiences with.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text">I have a pet's and one of them is a dog, a belgian malinoise and is a male he is very playful and is always stinky no-matter how much you clean him. One of the others is a cat named Misaki she's a female cat and a orange cat. Orange cat's are known to be so hyper almost everytime but its not as annoying as my dog's behavior.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text">My Girlfriend's name is Fianna and she's currently 16 yearsold the same age as I am but she's older by days. She's learning home economics and currently the only hobbies I know about her is that she plays bass-guitar and a ukulele and she likes to read some stories in the internet. Her favorite color is blue and green, I don't think she's sure about her future job as she said she wanted to be a flight attendant but also wanted to be a barista, but her goal is the same as mine, she wants to finish college and help her mom.</h3>
            <h3 class="small-text margin-text">Knowing that I have this kind of family in my life makkes me feel so lucy as all of us supports eachother's decisions. I'm so happy on how they affected my life some gave me obstacles to overcome and adapt to and some helps me through the journey of those obstacles. In conclusion I really love my family and I'm really happy to have them by my side.</h3>
